### Clayton Novotney, Kelson Flint,  Olivia
Interactive Data Analysis
For this assignment, you will explore the issues involved in implementing interactive visualizations. You will build a visualization that enables interactive exploration of a dataset of your own choosing and deploy it on the web.

You are encouraged to build on the work you've done in Assignment 2, but create a new section for this work (don't overwrite Assignment 2, leave it as a portfolio and grading artifact for the class. There are a few methods here: fork your repo and do this on a new GitHub pages URL, use the same GitHub pages URL and create a new section, or get fancy and use react router to create pages. 

One goal of this assignment is to gain familiarity implementing interaction techniques for visualizations. For example, the zipdecode (Links to an external site.) and NameVoyager (Links to an external site.) applications shown in class apply the interactive technique of dynamic queries to the problem of uncovering patterns in zip codes and baby names. We have seen many other examples of interactive visualization techniques in class and in the readings. The goal with this assignment is not only for you to gain hands-on implementation experience, but also for you to think about the effectiveness of the specific techniques for your chosen data domain.

One challenge is to scope the assignment so that you can finish it within two weeks. Focus on designing a limited yet compelling visualization that enables interactive exploration along a few critical dimensions. The NameVoyager (Links to an external site.) application is a nice example that uses a simple but elegant interaction design to enable engaging explorations. A tightly-focused, well-implemented interactive graphic is much preferred to a sprawling design that attempts too much!

### Team Registration
For this assignment you should work in teams of 3-5 students. You should attempt to find project partners that you will continue to work with for the final project, as the final project will build on your interactive visualization work.

### Deliverables
Design an interactive graphic aimed at enabling understanding of a compelling question for a dataset of your own choosing. In order to determine what subset of the data and which interactive options are most promising, you may want to perform additional exploratory analysis. What aspects of the data reveal the most interesting discoveries or stories? Do not feel obligated to try to convey everything about the data: focus on a compelling subset.

Your graphic must include interactions that enable exploration. Possible techniques include panning, zooming, brushing, details-on-demand (e.g., tooltips), dynamic query filters, and selecting different measures to display. You are free to also consider highlights, annotations, or other narrative features intended to draw attention to particular items of interest and provide additional context.

Implement your interactive graphic and deploy it to the web. We expect most students will use a combination of React & D3.js for this assignment. Your graphic should not require customized server-side support; you should simply load data from a static data file or public web API.

You should use GitHub pages to host your visualization (Links to an external site.) from your project repository. We recommend keeping everything (development files and website) in your main branch: either serve your website from the root folder or from the "/docs" folder. Your repo must also contain the (unobfuscated) source code for your visualization.

Your deployed webpage should also include a write-up with the following components:

- A rationale for your design decisions. How did you choose your particular visual encodings and interaction techniques? What alternatives did you consider and how did you arrive at your ultimate choices?
- An overview of your development process. Describe how the work was split among the team members. Include a commentary on the development process, including answers to the following questions: Roughly how much time did you spend developing your application (in people-hours)? What aspects took the most time?

### Grading Criteria
Projects that squarely meet the requirements for the assignment will receive a score of 9 (A). Going beyond the call of duty can net additional points, for example:
- advanced interaction techniques
- novel visualization elements
- effective multi-view coordination
- thoughtful and elegant graphic design
- insightful & engaging exploration experience
 

##### Point deductions will be made when projects suffer from:
- errors or broken features
- clearly ineffective visual encodings
- confusing interface design or unhelpful interactions
- lack of exploratory interaction techniques
- incomplete or insufficient write-up

#### Submission Details
Submission is the same as in Assignment 2: a URL to GitHub pages.
