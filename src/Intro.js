                <h2>Step 1: Data Selection</h2>
                <h4>Data Selected: Spotify Music Data from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/yamaerenay/spotify-dataset-19212020-160k-tracks">Kaggle.com</a></h4>
                <p>From this particular website, there were 7 different CSV files that we were able to choice from with different information being stored in each one.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>artists.csv</li>
                    <li>data_by_artist_o.csv</li>
                    <li>data_by_genres_0.csv</li>
                    <li>data_by_year_o.csv</li>
                    <li><b>data_o.csv</b></li>
                    <li>dict_artists.json</li>
                    <li><b>tracks.csv</b></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Looking at all of the different csv files, we found that we were most interested in the data_o.csv and tracks.csv files since they had the most unique information that we believe we could work with</p>
                <br></br>
                <p>The columns we are most interested in for the data_o.csv (28.44 MB) file are:</p>
                <p>
                    valence (positivity), year (Year), acousticness (How Acoustic the song is), artists (array of artists contributed), danceability (how suitable the song is for dancing), 
                    duration (time duration of song in ms), energy (how energetic the song is), instrumentalness (ratio of instrumental sounds)
                </p>
                <br></br>
                <p>The columns we are most interested in for the tracks.csv (106.21 MB) file are:</p>
                <p>
                    id (id of track), name (name of track), popularity (popularity of track), duration_ms (time duration of track in ms), explicit (whether it contains explicit (1) content or not (0)), artists (artists contributed to the track), 
                    id_artists (id of artists contributed to the track), release_date (the release date of the album containing this track), dancibility (how suitable the track is for dancing, 0(not danceable)->1(very danceable)), 
                    energy (how energetic the track is, 0(less energetic)->1(very energetic))
                </p>
                <br></br>

                    We got my data from a website called <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/yamaerenay/spotify-dataset-19212020-160k-tracks">Kaggle.com</a> and were able to execute certain SQL queries on the data set that was given.
